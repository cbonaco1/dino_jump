    <p>
      On press of spacebar, change the bottom property of the dino.
      Can get length of time the user held down spacebar (longer they hold it down, higher it jumps).
      Keep running score until game ends
      Not sure how to work carousel of level
      User can also make the dino duck by holding down down key (this changes height of dino)

      Add a class to obstacles
      -Give them a transition to left: 0 over 5 seconds (this moves them across the board)
